# Titanic competition 1st attempt

This is my first attempt at the Titanic competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
The notebook contains a classification model training and it generates an output based on the test set.
At the time of uploading on GitHub, the model is listed among the top 45% models.
